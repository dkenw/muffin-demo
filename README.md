# Deliswap Muffin Pool â€” swap demo

Python prototype to show how incoming order is split across fee tiers.

This implementation is simplified by only using full-range liquidity (instead of concentrated liquidity).

See [muffin_fullrange_demo.ipynb](muffin_fullrange_demo.ipynb) for usage.

Also see [our blog post](https://deliswap.medium.com/muffin-pool-e0945a360d29) for an introduction of Muffin Pool.
